-- Sales pitch + Design process

when thinking about online shopping, there are still some who are skeptical and they go to a website and are bombarded with bright
iages showing discounts and offers and its mostly very messy and hard to navigate. Thus it might make it uncomfortable for them especially
if they have not tried any online shoppping website.

Our goal is to make users feel comfortable and safe while browsing products. Thus, we have gone for a minimalist approach and made sure any images we use 
wasnt so overwhelming and surfing through our site would be easy and accessible. We also supposedly would have a chat feature where
buyers can communicate with the sellers to be more assured before buying products. Even the more complicated system of coins is just a small
icon that clearly says redeem now and when clicked, it is obvious what the user needs to do. We stuck to a few main colours with some contrasting colours as well.
our main colour code was green as it is associated with trustworthyness. We also promised some benefits as well such as fast delivery times
so that our clients would feel comfortable without stressing about when their products will come.

-- In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a online shopper, I want to make sure that i am recieving my products properly and they are cared for, so that I can feel at ease when buying my products.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

-- In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users to provide feedback by having them fill out a contact us form
Feature 2 - allows users to log in and keep their details by having them fill out a log in page
Feature 3 - allows users to create a listing for others to see and buy by having fill out a create a listing page
...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Feature 4 - allows buyers to communicate with sellers by using a chat feature
Feature 5 - make th coins function work such that when buying a listing you are given coins and it us updated in the database
Another feature idea
Feature 6 - allows buyers to promote certain sellers by giving them reviews

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
HTML
The project uses HTML as a base model for the website
CSS
The project uses CSS for designing the website
JS
The project uses JS for running login checks, api, and perform certain tasks backend in general
Assistive AI
In this section you should document the process of using AI tools eg, ChatGPT, Gemini etc to help you with the development of features/functionalities of your web application. (Failure to document your use of AI tools will result in loss of marks.) Example below:
we used AI to 
	- get the icons like our coins and chat icon
	- the ripple effect animation for a button
	- media query for Contact us
	- 
	- 


Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
